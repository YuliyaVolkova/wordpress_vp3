#### WHY USE Sunny LAnding pages? ###

Landing pages are powerful tools used by experienced marketers to grow online business.

A landing page is a dedicated page to convert your visitors into email subscribers, leads or directly into customers. Without dedicated pages for your campaigns, you will notice a much lower conversion rate. 

Landing pages are particularly effective in the following cases:

- Facebook or Google advertising: Drive traffic from Facebook or Google Ads to your landing page to convert anonymous visitors into leads, subscribers and customers.

- Email campaigns: If you have an email list and you want to build engagement through an offer like a webinar event, an exclusive discount offer etc. then directing the email subscribers to a landing page will help you increase conversions.

- eBook download: It's a popular way to build an email subscriber list. Offer a valuable download for free to incentivize people to sign up to your list. Use our landing pages to maximize these sign ups. 

We offer the quickest and most responsive customer support. Read our WP reviews to believe us. Reach out to us on the website helpchat.

#### Integrates with your email provider ###

Sunny Landing Pages supports the following email marketing & marketing automation tools among others:

- MailerLite
- MailChimp
- Constant Contact
- GetResponse
- Aweber
- Benchmark
- Zapier (Using Zapier you can connect your landing page to any email provider out there.)

The easiest way to integrate any of these email providers is to use their web form, embed form or sign up form and embed it into your Sunny Landing Page. 

Read about how to use our [Landing Page builder's Zapier integration](https://sunnylandingpages.com/blog/how-to-integrate-your-landing-page-with-zapier/) here.
